## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution

Project Name:
AI-Powered Todo Application — Spec-Driven Hackathon Project

Purpose:
Build a complete AI-driven Todo (Task Management) application using
Spec-Driven Development, where ALL source code is generated by AI.

The project evolves from a simple console application into a fully
cloud-deployed, AI-enabled system.

The goal is to train the developer as an AI-era system designer
who writes specifications instead of manual code.

--------------------------------------------------
Scope:
The project must be completed in 5 mandatory, sequential phases.
Each phase builds upon the previous one and cannot be skipped.

--------------------------------------------------
Phases Overview:

Phase I — Console Todo App
- Python-based terminal application
- Add, update, delete, and list tasks
- Simple in-memory or file-based storage
- No UI, terminal only

Phase II — Web Application
- Full-stack website
- User authentication (signup/login)
- Persistent database storage
- REST APIs for task management
- Modern frontend UI

Phase III — AI Chatbot Integration
- Conversational task management
- Natural language commands
- AI understands intent and manages tasks
- Chat-based UI

Phase IV — Local Deployment
- Dockerized services
- Kubernetes deployment using Minikube
- Helm charts
- Fully working local Kubernetes setup

Phase V — Cloud Deployment
- Deploy to DigitalOcean or Google Cloud
- Advanced task features:
  - Due dates
  - Recurring tasks
  - Priorities
  - Categories
- Event-driven architecture

--------------------------------------------------
Core Principles:
- Spec-driven development ONLY
- NO manual coding by the user
- AI generates 100% of code
- Clean and maintainable architecture
- Incremental phase-based delivery
- Production-quality output

--------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
- Free-tier friendly tools only
- No heavy GPU usage
- No skipping phases
- Each phase must pass validation

--------------------------------------------------
Philosophy:
Humans design systems.
AI writes code.
Engineers think in specifications, not syntax.

--------------------------------------------------
End Goal:
A fully functional, cloud-deployed, AI-powered Todo application
built entirely through AI using written specifications.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the AI-Powered Todo Application project. The constitution includes:

- Core Principles: Spec-Driven Development, AI-First Code Generation, Phase-Based Delivery, Clean Architecture, Production-Ready Quality, and Free-Tier Friendly Constraints
- Additional Constraints: Technology Stack Requirements, Security Requirements, and Performance Standards
- Development Workflow: Specification Requirements, Code Review Process, and Quality Gates
- Governance: Rules for constitution adherence and amendments

The constitution formalizes the project's core philosophy that "humans design systems, AI writes code" and establishes mandatory practices for the 5-phase development process.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational project constitution that governs all development activities
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for constitution creation
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with project specification and implementation phases
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution establishes clear governance for the spec-driven approach

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase I specification
