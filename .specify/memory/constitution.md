# AI-Powered Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
All development must begin with a clear, detailed specification before any code is written. No code should be written without a corresponding spec that defines requirements, acceptance criteria, and behavior. This ensures systematic, intentional development rather than ad-hoc coding.

### AI-First Code Generation
100% of source code must be generated by AI using specifications. No manual coding by humans is permitted. Humans are responsible for system design and writing specifications, while AI handles the implementation. This enforces the core philosophy that "humans design systems, AI writes code."

### Phase-Based Delivery
Development must follow the 5 mandatory sequential phases: Console App → Web App → AI Chatbot → Local Deployment → Cloud Deployment. Each phase must be completed and validated before proceeding to the next. No skipping or parallel development of phases is allowed.

### Clean Architecture
The application must follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns. Business logic must be independent of frameworks, databases, and UI. Dependencies flow inward from outer layers (UI, database, frameworks) to inner layers (business rules). This ensures testability and maintainability.

### Production-Ready Quality
All code must meet production standards from the beginning. This includes proper error handling, logging, testing, security considerations, and performance optimization. Code must be maintainable, scalable, and ready for deployment at any phase of development.

### Free-Tier Friendly Constraints
All technology choices must be compatible with free-tier services and cost-effective for development. No heavy GPU usage or expensive cloud resources should be required. This ensures the project remains accessible and sustainable.

## Additional Constraints

### Technology Stack Requirements
- Phase I: Python for console application
- Phase II: Full-stack web with persistent database (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- Phase III: AI integration (likely OpenAI API or similar)
- Phase IV: Docker and Kubernetes (Minikube) for local deployment
- Phase V: Cloud deployment (DigitalOcean or Google Cloud)
- All phases must use open-source or free-tier tools

### Security Requirements
- User authentication and authorization in Phase II and beyond
- Secure handling of user data and API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)

### Performance Standards
- Console application should respond within 1 second
- Web application should load pages within 3 seconds
- AI responses should return within 5 seconds
- Database queries should execute within 500ms

## Development Workflow

### Specification Requirements
- Each feature must have detailed specifications before implementation
- Specifications must include acceptance criteria
- Specifications must define error handling behavior
- Specifications must include test scenarios

### Code Review Process
- All AI-generated code must be reviewed by humans
- Reviews must verify compliance with specifications
- Reviews must check for security vulnerabilities
- Reviews must ensure code quality and maintainability

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merging
- Code coverage must be above 80%
- Security scans must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met

## Governance

This constitution governs all development activities for the AI-Powered Todo Application. All team members must adhere to these principles. Amendments to this constitution require explicit approval and must be documented with clear justification. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation must be justified and approved by project leadership.
